Background: During a college class, we were given a data set of an office supply company's order list to analyze. In the course we were taught how to use python along with pandas to access large data sets. Along with the professor’s guidance, I, along with a small team, created a recommendation based on our findings and queries to suggest areas where the company is losing value.
Data: The data set is a list of every transaction from each customer sold during the years from 2017-2020. Each transaction shows various fields like: 
•	product category
•	customer name
•	state
•	city
•	profit
•	sales
Goal: Utilize the given data set to provide insights on how the company could increase their profits/sales in the next years.
